/**
 * @defgroup renderers Output Renderers
 * 
 * The renderers are used to convert the cell structures read from the GDS layout file
 * into different output formats.
 * 
 * Currently the renders are statically implemented without the use of GObjects.
 * This will probably change in future releases in order to make it easier to integrate new rendering methods.
